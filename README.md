blackjackPy
===========

A Blackjack pie, hot and fresh out of the oven.  Play against the computer!

### How do I play?
Simple!  Fork this repo, then run:

```bash
$ python blackjack.py
```
NOTE: blackjack.py requires Python 3.

Please let me know of any bugs, I'm squashing them as fast as I can!  More detailed documentation, plus increased functionality will be coming shortly.

Thanks!
